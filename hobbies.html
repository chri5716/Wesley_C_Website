      <h1 id="hobbiesTitle">Hobbies & Activities</h1>
      <p>I enjoy activities that build focus, patience, and creativity. Below are three key hobbies with stories and why they matter to me.</p>

      <!-- Outdoors -->
      <section class="hobby" aria-labelledby="outdoorsTitle">
        <h2 id="outdoorsTitle">Going Outside</h2>
        <div class="hobby-grid">
          <img src="images/outdoor 2.jpg" alt="Lakeside trail by Lake Superior" loading="lazy">
          <div>
            <p>I regularly walk trails and spend time outside to recharge. Fresh air improves my concentration and helps me approach schoolwork with renewed energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal story:</strong> On a summer walk I sketched a timeline for a class project that later became my presentation plan — being outdoors helped me think creatively.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The ability to step back and reflect improves my planning and problem-solving in team projects and assignments.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Music -->
      <section class="hobby" aria-labelledby="musicTitle">
        <h2 id="musicTitle">Playing & Listening to Music</h2>
        <div class="hobby-grid">
          <img src="images/music 1.jpg" alt="Music setup with instruments and headphones" loading="lazy">
          <div>
            <p>I both play and listen to music. Playing requires focus and practice; listening helps me maintain sustained concentration during study blocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal story:</strong> I performed at a small community event and gained confidence speaking and performing in front of others.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Regular practice builds discipline — a quality I apply to study routines and professional development.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Fishing -->
      <section class="hobby" aria-labelledby="fishingTitle">
        <h2 id="fishingTitle">Fishing</h2>
        <div class="hobby-grid">
          <img src="images/fishing.jpg" alt="Fishing near a calm lakeside" loading="lazy">
          <div>
            <p>Fishing is a relaxing hobby that also teaches planning and patience. It’s a chance to reflect and learn about adapting to changing conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal story:</strong> During a rainy weekend trip I adjusted my approach and still caught fish — the experience reinforced adaptability and persistence.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Patience and adaptability are valuable in collaborative work, especially when faced with shifting project requirements.</p>
